These sides make people spend time on those, like walking around, or learning about tour side, instead of spending time slowly, people drive arround with played camera out the window, or playing efficiently as they work.\nSecond way people organize leisure time: Multitasks.

The discovery of fire, the invention of the wheel, the harnessing of electricity\u2014all were transformational moments for civilization. All were waves of Technology that started small, with a few precarious experiments, but eventually they broke across the world. These waves followed a similar trajectory: breakthrough technologies were invented, delivered huge value, and so they proliferated, became more effective, cheaper, more widespread and were absorbed into the normal, ever-evolving fabric of human life. _____________We are now facing a new wave of technology, centered around AI but including synthetic biology, quantum computing, and abundant new sources of energy. In many respects it will repeat this pattern. Yet it will also depart from it in crucial ways only now becoming clear. Amidst all the hype, the hope, the fear, I think the fundamentals are getting lost; the unique characteristics of this wave are getting missed in the noise. Understanding them, seeing what, exactly, is changing, is critical to understanding the future._______________________________________________",
